A challenge for developers to come up with useful applications or visualizations using the city’s data.</p>\n<p>Our app visualized Antwerp&#39;s nine districts on different parameters. We settled on a minimal donut chart, <a href=\"http://knife-io.github.com/Apps-for-Antwerp/\">see for yourself</a>.</p>\n<h2>A couple of principles that guided our design</h2>\n<h3>Incrementally display data</h3>\n<p>The visualization starts small with only a donut chart rolling out. By starting with a single item and incrementally adding items to the canvas one at a time, we guide the user&#39;s attention. The most important item is displayed first. Lesser items fade into the canvas later on.</p>\n<h3>Display little information to encourage user exploration</h3>\n<p>When everything has been displayed on the screen, only a disc and a form is displayed... nothing happens, not much information is conveyed. We do this to encourage users to start clicking around and exploring the graph themselves.</p>\n<h3>Remove all unnecessary information</h3>\n<p>Instead of using a map to display information, we chose a donut chart. This way, the user does not process unnecessary information like shape, location compared to other districts.</p>\n<p>All information has been stripped and the user can only digest information we want them to process.</p>\n<h3>Use movement to communicate change</h3>\n<p>By selecting different parameters, the area of a district will increase or decrease smoothly. We are hardwired to detect movement so it&#39;s easy to identify if something get&#39;s smaller or bigger.</p>\n<p>And because the user selects the parameters to change herself, she can select from what to what the movement occurs.</p>\n",
